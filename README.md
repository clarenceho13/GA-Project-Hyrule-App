# GA-Project-Hyrule-App

This is my second project during my time with General Assembly Singapore. 
The aim of the project is to create an app through an API. 

API Website: 
https://gadhagod.github.io/Hyrule-Compendium-API/#/?id=demo

Library: Semantic UI, https://react.semantic-ui.com/

Through this app, my purpose is to list out the various creatures, equipment and monsters found in the game, The Legend of Zelda: Breathe of the Wild.
